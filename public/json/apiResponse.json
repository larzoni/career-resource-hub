        "content": "In theory, an artist or band only really needs 1000 loyal fans to build a long, prosperous music career. We caught up with \"guitar slinging indie kids\" Tribe Friday, made up of Noah Deutschmann (singer), Isak Gunnarsson (guitar), and Robin Hanberger-Pérez (bass), to get their take on how to grow and maintain a strong relationship with your fans.\n\nHey Tribe Friday! Tell us a bit about your story – how did you meet?\nNoah: Hey! Nice to meet ya. I originally started the band as an after-school thing when I was in high school. I grew up in a small town in the north of Sweden, and most of my friendships revolved around music, so it felt like the natural thing to do. The project has evolved a lot since then - I first met Isak at a wine-fueled after-show party where he ended up tattooing my leg. He moved on to join the band in late 2019 after I called him saying I needed a guitarist for an upcoming US tour.\n\nIsak: I didn’t even play guitar at the time…\n\nRobin: I got to know Noah from hanging around the same music scene in Örebro, and seeing them at parties with mutual friends. At one of those parties Noah came up from behind and whispered \"hey, wanna join my band?\". The rest is history.\n\nNoah: I actually recorded Robin’s previous band in the studio. That’s how I found out how good of a bass player he is. I guess I kinda stole him from that band.",
